## Overview
This project aims to assist banks in optimizing their telemarketing campaigns to promote term deposits more efficiently. Rather than contacting all customers indiscriminately, we use machine learning to predict which customers are most likely to subscribeâ€”saving marketing costs and improving conversion rates.

## Business Background
In modern banking, customer deposits are essential for ensuring liquidity, funding loans, and maintaining financial stability. This project responds to a European bank's initiative to run a targeted telemarketing campaign to increase term deposit subscriptions.

By leveraging customer data and machine learning techniques, this project builds a predictive model to:
- Improve marketing precision
- Minimize operational costs
- Maximize customer conversion

## Objectives
- Identify high-potential customers for term deposits
- Develop an interpretable machine learning model
- Quantify marketing savings from data-driven targeting

## Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost, LightGBM
- Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- SHAP for model explainability

## Dataset
Data used in this project was adapted from the Bank Marketing Campaign Dataset, which contains information on previous telemarketing campaigns conducted by a particular banking institution.

## Project Workflow
- Business Understanding
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Modeling & Evaluation
- Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Interpretability with SHAP

## Key Results
- Improved model precision reduced the number of customers contacted from 1,561 to 536, resulting in significant marketing savings.
- Gradient Boosting and LGBM models provided the best performance.
- SHAP analysis highlighted key drivers influencing customer decisions.

## Business Impact
The model enabled the bank to save approximately EUR 8,217.50 per campaign by avoiding unnecessary outreach to uninterested customers.
